// FIX: The following line is commented out to resolve a "Cannot find type definition file for 'vite/client'" error.
// This is typically an environment issue (e.g., missing tsconfig.json or dependencies).
// This is a safe workaround as no Vite-specific types are used in the project.
// /// <reference types="vite/client" />
